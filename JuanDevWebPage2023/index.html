								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/JPCL-Grd.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>Hi, I'm Juan Pablo Canez, the founder and lead developer at JuanDev. With a passion for coding and a keen eye for design, I've spent over 5 years honing my skills in web development, crafting engaging and responsive websites that make an impact.

								My journey began in 2016 while working as an Analyst for an international logistics company. During that time, I had the privilege of contributing to a groundbreaking project aimed at streamlining logistics operations through software. This experience introduced me to the world of web development, where I immersed myself in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git.
								
								One of the most exciting aspects of my career has been collaborating with talented teams, including senior Software Engineers, and embracing new technologies like Angular and React. This willingness to learn and adapt has been instrumental in my growth as a developer.
								
								At JuanDev, my mission is clear: to provide you with exceptional web solutions that align with your unique goals. I'm dedicated to leveraging my expertise in front-end and back-end development, along with my commitment to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, to deliver efficient and innovative digital experiences.

								When I'm not coding, I enjoy [mention any relevant hobbies or interests], which often inspire my creative approach to web development.
								
								Thank you for considering JuanDev for your web development needs. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you and bring your digital vision to life.
